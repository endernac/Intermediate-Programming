* OVERVIEW *
In this submission are a suite of functions that perform various image
manipulation tasks. These functions are:

1. Swap
2. Invert
3. Crop
4. Edge Detection
5. Bright
6. Greyscale
7. Blur


* PROGRAM STRUCTURE *
The main functionality of this program (to manipulate user input images) can be
broken down into three steps:

1. Read and write image files (image IO)
2. Manipulate images
3. Provide a command line interface for the user (the main function)

We created three files to handle these roles: `ppm_io.c` handles file IO,
`image_manip.c` contains all functions for image manipulation, and `program.c`
houses the main function that the user calls. Within `program.c`, we perform all
of our input checks.

In all, the file tree for this program is very simple and looks like this:

cs220_midterm
 |
 +-- ppm_io.c
 +-- image_manip.c
 +-- project.c

Within `image_manip.c`, each feature specified in OVERVIEW is functionalized.
